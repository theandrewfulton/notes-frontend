## Installation

You are welcome do [visit the deployed site](https://upbeat-agnesi-735b00.netlify.app/) and explore the features and functionality there. The following installation instructions are for downloading the source code if you want to run the notes app locally in a development environment.

Please note the following notes were tested on Linux and should also work for macOS. They may also work for Windows Subsytem on Linx (WSL). If you are running Windows you can [find out more about WSL here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

## Frontend

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or just use npm - which ships with Node.js)

[Install git](https://git-scm.com/) if you want to clone the repository using the command line and use git for version control

[Go to the repository](https://github.com/theandrewfulton/notes-frontend)

click the Code button

Download ZIP or select the appropriate terminal option (https, ssh or Github CLI)

If you chose to download the Zip, extract it to your directory of choice once it has downloaded. Open notes-frontend

If using command line, navigate to your directory of choice (either by using the ```cd``` command, followed by the directory path) or by opening your file manager, navigating to the directory and then right-clicking and choosing *Open in Terminal*. Please note not all file managers support this.
clone the directory using ```git clone [add url from github here]```

e.g. ``` git clone git@github.com:theandrewfulton/notes-frontend.git```

Once this is complete, navigate into the directory with ```cd notes-frontend```

### Install packages

run ``` yarn install``` to install the required packages.

[add npm command]

Once this is complete, run ```yarn start``` to launch the frontend.

You can now also explore the project using the source code editor of choice.

### Backend

Git

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - version 3. I suggest using a version manager such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/rvm/install)

Rails - once ruby is installed run ```gem install rails``` - version 7 is used here

[postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - you may also need to install libpq-dev. [DigitalOcean has a great Postgresql tutorial for Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Need to create a user for postgresql

install instructions from repo the same as above

```bundle install```

```rails db:create```

```rails db:migrate```

```rails db:seed```

```rails s -p 4000```
